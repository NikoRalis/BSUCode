OVERVIEW:

This project will create a random walk on a grid after prompting you for the grid size and seed.
The RandomWalkTest is meant to make sure RandomWalk is doing what it should be doing.


INCLUDED FILES:

RandomWalk.java
RandomWalkTest.java
GridMap.java
RandomWalkGUI.java
README

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

When running RandomWalkGUI from the Konsole type  java RandomWalkGUI (your desired grid size  & your desired seed)
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

The design of the RandomWalk class is to set all the variables and to create the steps and walk.
In this class there is a check to make sure the walk doesn't go off the grid and it doesn't continue after it reaches the end.


PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

 In this project I tried to take each step slowly and make sure I totally understood what it was doing before I moved on. 
 My main issue in this project was getting and understand how to stop the stepping from going off the grid and in the right
 direction. I also got caught up on the while look in the RandomWalkTest class I was trying to set it up like we did with the dice
 roller lab but eventually got some help and figured it out. The only known issue I have (if it is an issue) is if I enter an invalid grid size
 it doesn't tell me there is an error until after prompting me for the seed. I liked this project a lot all of the instructions were straight forward
 but you still had to think for yourself. Something that finally clicked while doing this project was the need for this.grid size, I didn't fully
 comprehend why I needed it until Jake used his banana example with it.
