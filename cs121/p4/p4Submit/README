OVERVIEW:

This program reads in a text file and pulls statistics for it to print it them
out. 


INCLUDED FILES:

ProcessText.java
TextStatsistics.java
TextStatisticsInterface.java
TextStatisticsTest.java
README

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

from the directory containing the source files compile the program and run it
with the text file you want.
 
PROGRAM DESIGN:

 ProcessText checks for an error. TextStatisticsInterface gets all of the information.
 TextStatistics does all the heavy lifting; it gets the character count, word count,
 line count, letter count, word length, and the average word length. This class also
 formats everything to fit in a nice readable table.
 

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

 This program took me a lot longer than previous projects. I think this is mainly
 due to my lack of understanding in arrays. After struggling through it with some
 tutors I think I finally understand everything. The only thing I see that might 
 be a problem with my program is the formating on the length and frequency table.
 I liked this project despite the hard time I had my only problem with it was
 the wording is some parts of the instructions.
