OVERVIEW:

This project will create a random walk on a grid based on the number you enter for 
the grid size.If no grid size is entered the program will default to ten. This walk 
will create a safe path that the randomly spawned mines will not be able to spawn on.
If you click on a mine it will turn black and a life will be lost. If no mines are 
near by the box will be green, if there's one yellow, two orange, or three red.

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

Building this was one of the most challenging things I've done this year, 
but it was also one of the most fun things I've done. The MineWalker java class 
is what runs it all but most of my work was in the MineWalkerPanel class. If you want to
play the game compile and the the MineWalker class, the games gui should pop up and allow
you to play. I Decided to make my game harder than most by not allowing the player to play 
when the show mines and show path is pressed. To play after pressing these buttons you have
to start a new game not allowing you to cheat. Also to make the game more of my game
I have the prompts fairly sarcastic and a little rude because I find it funny, 
I apologize in advance if you do not find it funny.
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

The design of the RandomWalk class is to set all the variables and to create the steps and walk.
In this class there is a check to make sure the walk doesn't go off the grid and it doesn't 
continue after it reaches the end. using the RandomWalk MineWalkerPanel creates a safe path 
where the randomly created mines cannot land. This insures that there is a way to win. 
I found it easiest to create a methods for each action that needed to be performed so I could call it later. 

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:
This project took me numerous hours in the tutoring lab to complete. I tried to do it on my PC
but I kept having problems with MobaXTerm and Eclipse crashing my computer. This wasn't an issue
since I live on campus but it did set me back a few hours cause I lost work when Eclipse would
freak out. Besides the time the the only other set back I had was the logic involving the color
changing according to the mines, When the current point was close to an edge the method I created to check
the mines wasn't working. I was able to fix this with Catherine's help after a while and move on.
Of course this wasn't my only problem but It was the biggest one. I also couldn't get the timer to work.

Thanks for a great year Marissa!
