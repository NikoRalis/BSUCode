OVERVIEW:

This program prompts the user for three song's information stores it them finds the average play
time. Then the song finds the song closest to 4 mins. lastly the program builds a play list
from shortest to longest and prints them in oder.


INCLUDED FILES:

PlayList.java
Song.java
input.txt
README


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

From the directory containing the source files run PlayList.java and enter in song information.
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

I set most of my variables at the top then start the code asking for and storing the information
for the songs. After this the program will calculated the average play time of the songs them use
those calculations to print out the average. To determine the song closest to 4 minutes I used if
statements. Then to determine the first second and last song I had to use if, else if and else 
statements. finally I set up the table and had it pull from all the information above.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

The biggest challenges I faced in the project was the parsing mins and secs and the if statements
in finding the first second and last song for least to greatest. After saying it out loud and
trying to think logically I was able to figure it out. Up until now if statements didn't really
make sense to me but after having Shelby help me think about it, it finally clicked.
