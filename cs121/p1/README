PROGRAM DESIGN:

This program is very straight forward and will start running once you press run. It neededs no other commands.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

This project was a lot of fun however I did struggle throughout parts of it. My main problem I kept running into 
was the scaling of all the shapes. After multiple attempts and tutors' help I was able to figure it out and get 
all my shapes to act like I wanted them to. I wanted to use an image since my program is fairly bland and this 
proved to be another hurdle. Jake helped me figure out where I need to have the file and how to import it. I came 
in three times after my lab and worked on this project.
