Self Reflection (Discussion from README)
=================================================


   I personally really enjoyed this project because it seemed like an example of what we will be doing in the real world. Going in I didn't know what everything
   was doing so I started to pencil down what I need to do and the general flow of the progam. From there I started following the provided code and seeing where
   functions were and how to call them. After I had a general idea of how the program worked and what I needed to add I started adding in my alarm function and
   fixing the dump_log function. 

   I think from the beginning I had the right idea of how the program was working and what I needed to do but I wasn't sure how to properly use the alarm signal.
   Originally I was calling alarm(alarm_interval) in my log_msg() function, what I didn't realize is that this was reseting the alarm each time, not ticking it down
   like I thought. Once 'alarm(alarm_interval)' and 'signal(SIGALRM, onalarm)' were moved into my init_buffer() function my project worked. After this was solved
   I only had to add an additional log msg to the buff so I could pass the grader.

   Funny enough for the second check off I had added the functionality to write to a file before I had even got the program working.
