Project 1
  Author: Nik Morales
  Class: CS253 Section 2
  
Overview

  In the assignment I created a Makefile to to compile, run, and clean
  the project folder.

Compiling and Using

  To compile this project run 
  $make

  To run:
  $make run

  To clean:
  $make clean

Testing

  To test my code I had to do a run throughs before I realized I wasn't
  supposed to edit the fx.c files. After realizing I had screwed up those
  and in turn was screwing up my makefile I was able to fix them and my make
  file fairly easily.
  
Discussion
  After reviewing the slides and talking to a tutor about how a makefile works
  I was able to finally figure out what I was doing wrong. Reading the project
  description is definitely something I'm going to do more thoroughly  in the future.

Sources used

  The only sources I used for the program were the files provided and the slides on the class website.
