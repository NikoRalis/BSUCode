Overview

        This program is designed to simulate the bash program

Compiling and Using

        To compiling and use this prgram run:
                $make run
        This will compile and start the program so far you can change your directory
        and print out the argument passed in.

Testing

        The major problem I ran into during this program was trying to pring the working
        directory, Turns out we didn't need that and it was making me fail backpack.
