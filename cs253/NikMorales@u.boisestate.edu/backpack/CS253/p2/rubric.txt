Grade: 70/70

(-5 pts) Inconsistent indentation makes code difficult to read.
(-15 pts) Reflection not done in class. Very brief.

=================================================
- Passing all grader scripts (50 points): 50/50

  Reflection:
	Does the grader check everything? yes.
	What doesn't it check? NA
	How did you test things before running the grader? I ran the grader to see why it was failing then used that to check my code.

- Code quality (10 points): 10/10
	The programmer makes consistent use of indentation
	The programmer makes consistent use of braces
	#include directives are listed at the top of the file
	#define directives are at the top of the file, after includes
	The programmer makes use of comments where necessary
	There are no unnecessary lines of code (e.g. commented, unused code)
	No global variables are used
	The names of constants defined by #define are in all CAPITAL letters
	Variable names are descriptive
	Variable name casing is consistent (e.g. camelCase or underscore_separation)
	Variables are all initialized before use

  Reflection:

- README.md: 10/10
	Follows the required format.
	Is descriptive about how to compile and use.

  Reflection:

The main problem I had doing this project is I really wanted to have
a PWD function, however the grader wouldn't pass with it in so I commented it
out for future use. Also sorry I forgot to do this earlier.
