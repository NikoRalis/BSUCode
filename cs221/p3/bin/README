ANALYSIS:

What is the order of state evaluation and new state generation for a Storage object that uses a 
stack compared to one that uses a queue?


How is the total number of search states affected by the choice of stack or queue?
What is the Big-Oh runtime for the search algorithm? Quadratic 
How is memory use (the number of states in Storage at one time) affected by the choice of underlying structure?
Does using one of the storage structures find a solution faster than the other? Always?
Does using either of the storage structures guarantee that the first solution found will be an ideal solution?
